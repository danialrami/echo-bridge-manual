 Echo Bridge is a reverb, tremolo, and delay pedal. The original goal of this pedal was to emulate the sound of the bridge by Tandem, but I got carried away and now it's more like a Strymon Flint + a delay lol. It can still do Echo Bridge -- as well as many other spaces -- and is an all around fun time-based multi-effect ü§ù see patch notes below.

### Factory Reset (Restore default reverb parameters)

To enter factory reset mode, **press and hold** **Footswitch #2** when powering the pedal. The LED lights will alternate blinking slowly.

1. Rotate Knob #1 to 100%. The LEDs will quickly flash simultaneously and start blinking faster.
2. Rotate Knob #1 to 0%. The LEDs will quickly flash simultaneously and start blinking faster.
3. Rotate Knob #1 to 100%. The LEDs will quickly flash simultaneously and start blinking faster.
4. Rotate Knob #1 to 0%. The LEDs will quickly flash simultaneously, defaults will be restored, and the pedal will resume normal pedal mode.

To exit factory reset mode without resetting. Power off the pedal and power it back on.

### Acknowledgements

- The hardware is a Hothouse by [Cleveland Music Co](https://github.com/clevelandmusicco), which provided a base for development.
	- The algo and pedal is based on the Daisy Seed, which means that if you really wanted, you could reflash [a bunch of other effects](https://github.com/clevelandmusicco/HothouseExamples) onto this pedal! It's super fun and addicting
%%-  The software is a fork of [Flick](https://github.com/joulupukki/hothouse-effects/tree/main/src/Flick), with the Datorro reverb algo modified to be closer to the original Echo Bridge frequency curve. The controls work the same as the original, so feel free to try out the original effect to hear the difference! %%
